His study has shown no change in the pattern of CJD since BSE started and no other cases among people working with cattle , such as abattoir staff or vets .
It was revealed this week that Mr Peter Warhurst , a dairy farmer whose herd had a BSE case in 1989 , died last year of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease .
One cause of concern is that the number of cases is continuing to rise , in spite of forecasts from the Ministry of Agriculture that the incidence of cases would peak last year and then decline rapidly .
Farmers reported 8,581 animals with BSE during the first nine weeks of this year compared with 8,099 in the same period last year .
