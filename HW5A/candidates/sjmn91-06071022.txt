; The department is clearing some areas by setting small fires that are tightly controlled , the first of which recently burned off 335 hillside acres in the Monte Nido area of Malibu.
; `` This year is shaping up to be the worst fire season we 've ever experienced , '' said Warner McGrew , assistant fire chief at Santa Barbara , where the drought is worst and where brush fires destroyed 600 homes and did $ 200 million damage last year.
; The area at risk of severe fires spreads beyond California and takes in about a third of the United States mainland , including Oregon and Washington east of the Cascades and much of Nevada , Arizona , Utah , Colorado , Wyoming , Idaho , Montana and the Dakotas.
; But the threat is most extreme in California , where the December freeze added to the accumulation of dead vegetation , or fuel , as firefighters call it.
