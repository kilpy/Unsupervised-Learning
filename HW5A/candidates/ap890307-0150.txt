`` You ca n't tell the difference between a partial eclipse and a second-stage smog alert , '' joked one observer at Caltech .
Fearful that people would suffer eye damage during the eclipse , scientists warned against staring at the sun directly or through inadequate filters , including smoked glass and photographic film or filters .
Total solar eclipses are visible from any single location roughly once every four centuries , though they are visible about every two years from somewhere on Earth , he said .
`` There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature , '' said Ed Krupp , director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles , where 600 children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37 percent of the sun 's surface at 10:50 a.m. PST .
