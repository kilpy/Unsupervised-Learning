Commission counsel Robert Armstrong said it was `` totally irresponsible that Dr. Astaphan made such statements outside of the commission and not under oath where they are available to be tested by cross-examination . ''
Astaphan said Johnson was not on stanozolol when he beat Lewis in a world-record time of 9.79 seconds for the 100 meters gold , a medal taken away from him when he then tested positive for stanozolol use by Olympics officials .
`` He bought stanozolol or somebody bought it for him in Toronto , '' Astaphan told the newspaper .
But immediately after taking it Johnson suffered `` violent muscle spasms . ''
