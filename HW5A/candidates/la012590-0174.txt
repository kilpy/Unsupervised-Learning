The charges from the Valdez cleanup were partly offset by a one-time gain from a change in accounting methods in the first quarter as a result of changes in federal tax law .
The office 's operations will be transferred to Midland , Tex.
Meanwhile , Exxon confirmed Wednesday that it would shut down its Denver exploration and production office , which employs about 105 people .
The previous charges covered everything from wages to boat rentals to boots , as well as payments so far of $ 177 million in claims by fishermen , cannery workers and other individuals affected by the spill , said Exxon spokesman James Robertson in Anchorage .
