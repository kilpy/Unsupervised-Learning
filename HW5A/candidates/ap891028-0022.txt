The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs .
An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area , 4 moderate damage , 5 considerable damage , 6 severe damage .
Major earthquakes in the Solomons usually do n't cause much damage or many casualties because the area is sparsely populated and not extensively developed .
The earthquake struck the islands at 8:05 a.m. today , or 5:05 p.m. EDT Friday , said USGS spokesman Don Finley .
