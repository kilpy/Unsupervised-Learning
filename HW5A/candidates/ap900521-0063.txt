In Wyoming , the Centers for Disease Control recorded no new cases of TB in 1989 , demonstrating that it is a condition that can be controlled and cured , according to Dr. Lee B. Reichman , director of the pulmonary division of the University of Medicine and Dentistry in New Jersey .
Reichman noted that most American have forgotten about the problems of TB ; from 1981 to 1984 , TB cases declined an average of 6 percent per year according to the Centers for disease control .
Snider also said doctors should administer TB tests to all persons testing positive for the HIV virus since TB may not be readily diagnosed in AIDS patients .
Tuberculosis can be effectively treated , even in AIDS patients , underscoring efforts to screen persons for the disease , the doctor said .
