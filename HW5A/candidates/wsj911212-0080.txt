Here we see the link of the private and public aspects of bearing arms .
In this version , `` bearing arms '' must mean `` to render military service , '' or why else would there have to be an exemption for religious reasons ?
More evidence of the connection can be found in the Militia Act of 1792 .
When reporting for service , every militiaman was required to provide a prescribed rifle or musket , and ammunition .
