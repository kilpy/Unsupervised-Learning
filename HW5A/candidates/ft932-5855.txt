Mr Abel Guerra of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce said he feared side agreements dealing with issues on the environment and labour rights could jeopardise Nafta .
` Those sectors of the US economy most vulnerable to import penetration are those sectors most dependent on recent immigration for their labour force . '
Leaders of important Hispanic coalitions such as La Raza , a civil rights group , and the Southwest Voter Registration Project said they feared Hispanics in the US would bear the brunt of the negative impact of Nafta .
The announcement will deal a blow to supporters of Nafta , who counted on Hispanic backing to get the agreement through Congress .
