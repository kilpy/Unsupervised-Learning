Johnson , who clocked 9.79 in that race , lost the record and his gold medal , and was barred from competition for two years after testing positive for an anabolic steroid .
`` I would have to see the evidence , but if he was on drugs at the time of the World Championships , my thought would be to remove his record , '' said Ollan Cassell , executive director of The Athletics Congress , the national governing board for the sport .
The issue would be decided at the IAAF Congress , scheduled for Barcelona , Spain , in September .
Ben Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100-meter dash and it should be awarded to Carl Lewis , many U.S. track and field officials and athletes said Wednesday in the aftermath of Johnson admitting to his steroid use .
