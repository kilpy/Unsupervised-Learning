Premier Lojze Peterle and other Slovenian leaders also say Slovenia should take urgent steps to join the European Community , no matter what Yugoslavia 's Communist-ruled southern states say .
The timing of Monday 's proclamation by Slovenia may have been affected by Serbia 's sudden decision last week to hold a special referendum Sunday and Monday on adopting consitutional reforms that would virtually destroy any remaining autonomy for its troubled province of Kosovo .
Slovenia contains 2 million of Yugoslavia 's total population of 23 million .
Monday 's parliamentary declaration provides for establishing an independent legal system that would take precedence over federal laws and for Slovenian control over armed forces stationed in the republic , state media said .
