The department has forecast a food price increase this year of 3 percent to 5 percent .
`` Today 's reports confirm that the drought has had a major impact on this year 's crops , '' Wilson told reporters .
The total grain supply for 1988-89 _ which includes inventories on hand at the beginning of the season _ is down 24 percent from last season .
Wilson said USDA experts `` continue to believe that the drought will add only one percentage point '' to consumer food prices this year .
