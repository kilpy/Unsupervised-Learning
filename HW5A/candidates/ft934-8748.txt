Most Wall Street economists are pro-Nafta , as are the majority of business leaders , if recent polls are to be believed .
Investors ' darkest fear is that a no vote on Nafta would throw such a spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of international protectionism , higher inflation and slower world economic growth .
Investors fear that a rejection of Nafta would have dangerous knock - on effects around the world , depressing share prices in the US , Latin America and eventually Europe , and endangering vital trade negotiations over the Uruguay Round .
Share prices in Mexico rose on Wednesday and Thursday , and US stocks made solid gains , following the televised debate on Tuesday between Vice-President Al Gore and Ross Perot , who is Nafta 's most celebrated opponent .
