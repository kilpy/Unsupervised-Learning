Patience was its own virtue in the Long Beach Marathon Sunday , as the men 's and women 's winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun -- which was obscured by cloud cover early in the race -- to burn through and take a toll on the runners .
Guadalupe Roman of Mexico led through much of the race but lost ground steadily in the last five miles and finished sixth .
Wilson also made a move , or more precisely , he continued his steady 5:03 mile pace while the rest of the field slowed from the early , faster pace .
Tomio Bueyoshi of Japan was second in 2:15:31 and Liu Wenzun of China was third in 2:19:16 .
