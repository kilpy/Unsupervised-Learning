The drought region now extends well into West Virginia and includes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky and Tennessee , the weather service drought advisory said .
The only areas escaping heat in the forecast are the nation 's northwestern and northeastern corners and the Louisiana-Texas-New Mexico area .
In addition , drought conditions persist over large areas of the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains .
Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts along the U.S.-Canadian border , possibly triggering scattered showers in the extreme northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley .
