`` Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform , '' the president said .
President Reagan warned Saturday that he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him that does not contain a work requirement .
`` Now , Congress appears to be close to a decision about welfare reform and I have a message for them , '' he said .
`` If Congress presents me with a bill that replaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of self-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans on welfare , I will use my veto pen . ''
