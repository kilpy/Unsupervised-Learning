As well as selling the stones mined by De Beers and other South African companies , the organization trades on behalf of diamond producers including Zaire , Australia , Botswana and the Soviet Union .
The Office of Fair Trading said it would first have to establish whether it had jurisdiction over the Central Selling Organization because although it is based in London , De Beers is a South African company .
A Consolidated Gold spokesman , commenting on condition he was not identified , said the company wanted to point up the `` monopolistic tendencies '' of South Africa 's Anglo-American group of companies .
