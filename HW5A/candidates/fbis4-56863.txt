The Central Committee Plenum that `` Feliciano '' presided over in order to break away from the Black Group orders the `` unleashing of a massive reassertion movement based on the BUP throughout the party , the People 's Liberation Army , and among the masses of the New Power . ''
Under the guise of defending the party , they are undermining it and its leadership so as to bring about its defeat , by using empty rhetoric to disguise their partisan , opportunistic , and personal interests and ambitions , and by taking a blind , biased , subjective , and superficial approach to concrete reality .
The five-point document issued at the end of the meeting is attached to lengthy citations of speeches by Abimael Guzman and documents signed by him that show why the war must not end .
The Dincote report lists the steps that `` Feliciano 's '' followers are taking to carry out actions that would put Shining Path back in the political picture .
