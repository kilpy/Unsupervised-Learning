Many states have already embarked on far-reaching welfare reform programmes , such as Michigan 's 21-point plan to strengthen families or New Jersey 's family development programme .
These suspicions were enhanced when Ms Donna Shalala , new secretary of health and human services , last month devoted only one sentence to welfare reform in a five-page statement of goals .
As a result , few states have been able to implement in full the act 's requirement that welfare recipients take part in some form of education or training .
Mr Clinton said he would let states experiment with such programmes , even when he disagreed with them .
