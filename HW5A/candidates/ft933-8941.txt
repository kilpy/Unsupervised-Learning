De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to concentrate instead on another site 60km away and , importantly , given the heat generated by the politics of the region , across the border in South Africa .
The deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5 m tonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds , and since mining started in March last year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds , 60 per cent of them of gem quality , Mr Baxter-Brown said .
Also , all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared from the Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines .
But as Mr Baxter-Brown pointed out : ' 330,000 carats a year is no threat to De Beers . '
