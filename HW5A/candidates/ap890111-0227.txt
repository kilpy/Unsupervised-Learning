Because of the unprecedented fire season which burned nearly 1.5 million acres in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem , including 705,000 acres within the national park , Mrs. Smith and her friends and neighbors worry about what 's happening underneath the blanket of snow this winter .
The U.S. Forest Service , which coordinated some of its firefighting efforts from Cooke City , set up shop near the photocopy machine , and everybody who had information or was seeking some crammed into the Smiths ' log cabin office .
Like nearly everybody else in Cooke City and Silver Gate , Mrs. Smith says she never wants to go through another summer like the last one .
Although the 5.9 million acres burned in 1988 did not match the 28 million acres destroyed in 1926 , the $ 583.8 million spent to fight 75,000 fires set a record .
