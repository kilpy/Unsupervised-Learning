A quake of 7 magnitude , a `` major '' earthquake , is capable of widespread heavy damage .
In some areas of Southern California , there is a higher probability of a major quake occurring .
He noted that the 1988 report , titled `` Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault , '' presented information that was already widely known among scientists .
The high probability is based on several factors , including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906 , said Clarence Allen , professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena .
