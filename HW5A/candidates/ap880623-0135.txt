`` Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states , including both legal and illegal aliens , '' added Rep. Don Edwards , D-Calif .
The result , he said , was that Georgia and Indiana lost House seats to New York and California .
`` This is a fairness issue , '' said Rep. Thomas J. Ridge , R-Pa. , who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliens benefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extra seats in the House .
and William F. Goodling , R-Pa. , asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens ' basic right to equal representation by giving greater voice in Congress to states where the aliens live .
