The court has not defined what it means by `` extraordinary defects , '' but surely the fact that 98 % of House incumbents are routinely re-elected and that one out of five incumbents ran with no major-party opposition in 1990 might qualify .
Nor do they prevent a House member who has reached a term limit from running for the U.S. Senate or vice versa .
They claimed there is a `` fundamental right to be a candidate for public office , '' which they found among the `` associational rights '' in the First Amendment .
Elsewhere , the court in 1988 ruled in South Carolina v. Baker , that certain `` extraordinary defects in the national political process might render congressional regulation of state activities invalid under the Tenth Amendment . ''
