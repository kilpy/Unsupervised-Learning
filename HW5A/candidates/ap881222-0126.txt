The Thunderbolt II is also one of the safest planes , statistically , in the Air Force inventory .
The aircraft has chalked up a major accident rate of less than 4 Class A mishaps per 100,000 flying hours over its lifetime _ which now consists of more than 1.75 million flight hours .
The Air Force later corrected that statement , saying the A-10 was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Alconbury .
It was the second crash of a Thunderbolt jet in Europe in two weeks .
