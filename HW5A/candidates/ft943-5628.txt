This year will be a time of consolidation .
Here worn out equipment will be stockpiled and sold off when the mine closes .
Venetia is also breaking with the De Beers ' tradition that , for security reasons , no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security area once it is no longer useful .
Mr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be well below the 5.6 m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield at full production .
