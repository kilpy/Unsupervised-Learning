AIDS weakens the immune system , making patients susceptible to infections other people might ward off , including tuberculosis .
Tuberculosis , a contagious , bacterial lung disease , occurs in about 22,000 new cases each year in the United States ; most can be cured with drug treatment .
`` In some large correctional systems , the incidence of TB has increased dramatically , '' the CDC said , noting that in New York state there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986 _ seven times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78 .
In New Jersey , inmates had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987 , 11 times higher than the general New Jersey population .
