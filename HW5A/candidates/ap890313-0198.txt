`` The problem with Type II diabetics is not that they do n't make enough insulin ; they do n't respond to the insulin , '' DeFronzo said .
The drug is widely used in Europe , Canada and Mexico and should be approved by the Food and Drug Administration in several years for U.S. use , he said .
Type I diabetes usually develops among adolescents and requires that they have daily injections of insulin .
`` We do n't know why , when they get diabetes , they have a more severe form of the disease _ whether it 's a biological difference or is it that they are not getting as good medical care .
