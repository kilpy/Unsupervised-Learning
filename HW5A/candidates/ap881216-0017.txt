The panel 's report will remain open for public comment for 60 days before any recommendations are adopted .
A recommended halt to the government 's `` let it burn '' forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the Western fire season next spring , according to the co-chairman of a panel that suggested the moratorium .
`` My guess is that the moratorium would be finished by the beginning of the Western fire season , which is the middle of May , '' Charles Philpot , co-chairman of the review panel , told a news conference .
Experts say fire renews forests , giving new species a chance to grow , encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients .
