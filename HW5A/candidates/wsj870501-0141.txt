During the January strike , the guerrillas killed an alleged thief and a seller of coca-paste cigarettes , according to a crop substitution program worker who works directly with the farmers in the area .
The guerrillas are held responsible for assassinating six mayors in the area since 1985 , including two mayors from Aucayacu , which has 3,500 residents .
The commander of the anti-drug police , Gen. Juan Zarate , says there are few guerrillas in the Upper Huallaga and denies that an alliance exists between the drug traffickers and the Shining Path .
For three days they shut down the 50-mile road from Tingo Maria to Rio Uchiza -- the only continuous , paved road in the valley .
