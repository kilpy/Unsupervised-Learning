It was the slowest winning women 's time since Waitz 's 2:32:30 in 1978 .
Douglas Wakiihuri , a Kenyan who trains in Japan , was the overall winner and Poland 's Wanda Panfil , who lives in Mexico , was the women 's winner in Sunday 's race which was plagued by heat and humidity .
In only seven previous marathons , the 27-year-old Wakiihuri has won the '87 world championship , the '89 London Marathon in a personal-best 2:09:03 and the '90 Commonwealth Games marathon .
It was the first time she had finished the race without winning .
