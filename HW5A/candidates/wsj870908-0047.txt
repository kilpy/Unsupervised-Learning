In 1985 , at the low point of a deep slump , a top quality stone was $ 8,500 a carat , down from an average of $ 55,000 in 1980 .
Yet some dealers worry because world diamond production surged to 89.6 million carats last year from 47 million carats in 1982 .
To meet growing orders from diamond dealers and cutters who supply the retail trade , De Beers sales of rough diamonds jumped to $ 1.56 billion in the first half of this year from $ 1.2 billion in the similar period in 1986 .
Analysts are predicting sales of $ 3 billion in 1987 .
