The German government yesterday announced the launch of a new research project to examine whether the cattle disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy -LRB- BSE -RRB- can be transmitted to human beings .
The initiative comes as the country is pushing for a European Union ban on British beef imports , arguing that there is still no conclusive evidence that the disease can not affect humans .
Seven German universities and research institutes will be sponsored by the country 's research and technology ministry to examine possible connections between the origins of BSE and two other diseases , Creutzfeldt Jakob disease and Gerstmann Straussler syndrome , which very rarely affect humans .
Several German scientists have expressed concern that BSE - popularly known as ` mad cow disease ' because of the way it debilitates the brains of cattle - may be transmissible to humans who eat contaminated beef or take medicines made with ingredients from contaminated animals .
