A major earthquake registering 7.2 on the Richter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today , the U.S. Geological Survey says .
The preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area Oct. 17 .
The earthquake struck the islands at 8:05 a.m. today , or 5:05 p.m. EDT Friday , said USGS spokesman Don Finley .
It was the largest earthquake in the Solomons since a 7.4 quake on Nov. 5 , 1978 .
