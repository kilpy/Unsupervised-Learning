Hurricane Chantal , the first of the season , aimed for the Texas and Louisiana coasts Monday , a day in which the storm 's winds capsized an oil drilling work vessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside .
Three of the crewmen were picked up by a nearby fishing vessel and a fourth was plucked from the water by a Coast Guard helicopter .
The Coast Guard also said there were unconfirmed reports that two others had been picked up by another boat .
Rescue divers , however , were unable to search the overturned service vessel for survivors because of increasingly strong winds and high waves .
