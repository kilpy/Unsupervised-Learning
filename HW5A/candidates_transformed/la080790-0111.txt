As they scanned the flow of passengers at Los Angeles International Airport , police detective Clayton Searle and his fellow narcotics officer searched for the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby .
When Searle noticed a short , muscular black man walk toward them and then turn abruptly toward a bank of telephones , the plainclothes Los Angeles police detective moved in quickly to question him .
Within minutes , however , their words had turned into violence , and the two men toppled to the terminal floor where Searle handcuffed his suspect and pulled him to his feet .
Placing his hand across the man 's mouth , the officer then marched him away before a gathering crowd of gaping passersby .
