From Hawaii to Mexico to Central America , more than 40 million people saw the moon obscure so much of the sun that only a blazing ring was visible .
In Hawaii , Mauna Loa erupted for the first time in six years , stunning scientists by releasing a dazzling fountain of lava at the height of the eclipse.
; And in the Bay Area , more than half the sun was covered when the eclipse peaked at 11:20 a.m. .
The world will not see such a long-lasting eclipse for another 151 years.
