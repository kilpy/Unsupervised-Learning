Supercomputers , satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path Hurricane Hugo would follow , giving people plenty of time to flee the South Carolina coast .
But hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science .
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugo 's path into Charleston , S.C. `` All the world 's knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models , '' said Thomas Pyke , head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's satellite service .
Pinpointing the exact point of Hugo 's landfall was difficult , but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation .
