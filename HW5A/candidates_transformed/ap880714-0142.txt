The focus of the drought plaguing much of the nation has shifted eastward , but little relief is in sight for most areas , the National Weather Service reported Thursday .
The new short-range forecast through next Monday calls for hot , dry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic states .
Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts along the U.S.-Canadian border , possibly triggering scattered showers in the extreme northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley .
The heavy rain which has hit portions of Texas is expected to diminish .
