Johnson _ stripped of his Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter final after he tested positive for the banned steroid stanozolol _ also was taking steroids when he set a world sprint record last summer in Rome , the Toronto Star newspaper quoted Ms. Issajenko as saying .
Ms. Issajenko , who also competed in the Olympics in Seoul , South Korea , was quoted as saying she also took the muscle-building drug .
