Flexing its muscles as a cartel , De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is raising its diamond prices an average 10 % next month .
The South African concern , which controls 80 % of the world diamond market through its London-based Central Selling Organization , sells a vast array of diamonds , varying in quality and size , dealers say .
So the increase could be as much as 20 % on top-grade diamonds .
The rise follows an average price increase of 14.5 % last year .
