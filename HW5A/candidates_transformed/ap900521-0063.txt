Tuberculosis is alarming health officials again because it 's posing new health threats with its connection to the AIDS virus .
A 35 percent increase in tuberculosis in 1989 in Newark , N.J. , has caught the attention of health officials , who had been previously recording with satisfaction a slow , steady decrease in TB cases over the last few decades .
They attribute the 5 percent national increase in TB cases in 1989 to the ravages of the AIDS virus , which destroys the body 's immune system and leaves victims open to TB infection , Dr. Philip C. Hopewell of San Francisco General Hospital said Sunday .
Hopewell and other health officials discussed the link between AIDS and TB during the a four-day World Conference on Lung Health in Boston , which ends Wednesday .
