The Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was investigating a complaint alleging anti-competitive practices by a London-based diamond cartel controlled by South Africa 's giant De Beers diamond organization .
The watchdog body said De Beers `` appeared to have '' a monopoly on diamond trading in London and it was interested in establishing whether there had been an abuse of the monopoly .
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC , a British mining concern with no diamond interests , acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by Luxembourg-based Minorco SA .
Minorco is 60.1 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. , the gold and diamond mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimer family of South Africa .
