THE Clinton administration will soon announce support for a North American Development Bank , which would fund projects in communities hit by job losses resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement .
The so-called NADBank has been strongly supported by Congressman Esteban Torres , who has insisted on some sort of lending institution to support adjustment throughout the continent .
Agreement by the administration is expected to bring Mr Torres and at least 7 other Hispanic congressmen into the pro-Nafta fold .
The administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-Nafta votes , out of the 218 needed .
