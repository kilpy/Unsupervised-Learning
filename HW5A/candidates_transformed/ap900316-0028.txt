A steady decline in tuberculosis has all but stopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS-infected , federal health researchers say .
In 1988 , the last year for which complete statistics are available , 22,436 U.S. tuberculosis cases were reported , down 0.4 percent from 1987 , the national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday .
That slight drop compares with an average annual decrease of 6.7 percent from 1981 to 1984 .
One reason for the slowing of progress in wiping out TB is `` the increasing occurrence of TB in persons infected with ... HIV , '' the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome , the CDC said .
