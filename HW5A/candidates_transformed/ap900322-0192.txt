A stone 's throw from the smelly Smithfield meat market is an office building complex with no sign or anything to attract the attention of Londoners hurrying by .
Mounted cameras , jumpy guards and heavy doors keep out the uninvited .
The gold-colored interior is hushed and luxuriously decorated .
This is the Central Selling Organization , London-based marketing arm of the De Beers diamond empire , controlled by the wealthy Oppenheimer family of South Africa .
