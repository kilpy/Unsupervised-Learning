A Long Beach-bound Exxon oil tanker ran aground on a reef Friday and spilled an estimated 8.4 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska 's Prince William Sound , a pristine Pacific waterway heavily used by kayakers , fishermen and tourists .
It was the largest Alaskan oil spill ever .
The Exxon Valdez , a 987-foot tanker owned by Exxon Shipping Co. , rammed the reef about 25 miles from the city of Valdez , the northernmost ice-free port in the United States , at 12:30 a.m. Coast Guard officers speculated that the ship 's captain may have been trying to avoid icebergs from the nearby Columbia Glacier when the accident occurred .
