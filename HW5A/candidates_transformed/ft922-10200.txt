LOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one of the most brutal police forces in the country : now he is under attack for fuelling the violence and then standing by as it rolled across poor black neighbourhoods .
Mr Gates acknowledged yesterday that his department had been overwhelmed by the scale of the violence .
Police could only look on , outnumbered , as crowds looted shops , and moved in mostly to protect firefighters from attack .
The controversial police chief was said to have argued on Wednesday , the first night of rioting , against sending in National Guard troops , and only to have bowed later to evidence that his police force was incapable of handling the violence .
