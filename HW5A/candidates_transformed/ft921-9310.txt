THE CONDITION known in cattle as ` mad cow disease ' , spongiform encephalopathies , has been found in Britain 's sparsely-scattered antelope population , the government has admitted .
Three elands , three greater kudu and an arabian oryx have been diagnosed with the disease over the past three years .
In all , six species other than cattle have been confirmed with the condition during this period .
The statistics - released in response to a written question from Mr Ron Davies , a Labour agriculture spokesman - show a disconcertingly rapid increase in the number of sheep found to have the disease .
