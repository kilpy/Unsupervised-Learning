While more than a thousand runners were treated to an evening of comedy , music and magic at Saturday night 's carbo load dinner on Mission Bay , Ernesto Beatriz Martinez of Mexico City was treated to a bumpy 12Â 1/2 - hour bus ride from his hometown to border town Tijuana .
Not until early Sunday morning did Beatriz Martinez , 29 , cross the U.S. / Mexican border to register for , then reach the starting line of , the San Diego International Marathon on East Mission Bay Drive .
His recovery was simply amazing .
Two hours , 16 minutes and 12 seconds later , in only his second marathon -- his first was this event last year when he finished eighth -- Beatriz Martinez crossed the finish line 39 seconds ahead of South African Mark Plaatjes , now of Lake Forest , Ill. .
