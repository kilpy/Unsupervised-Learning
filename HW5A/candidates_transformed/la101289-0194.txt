Consuelo wishes she could share her First Communion this year with Abuelita .
She misses her grandmother very much .
Abuelita was not very old -- just 62 -- but there was not much the doctors could do to save her life .
She had uncontrolled diabetes : her kidneys were failing , her blood pressure was too high and she finally died of a heart attack .
