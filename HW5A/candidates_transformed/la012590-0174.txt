Exxon Corp. on Wednesday increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of cleaning up the massive Alaskan oil spill to $ 2 billion and said it would take another $ 500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history .
In reporting its estimated 1989 earnings , Exxon said it would take a $ 500-million charge in the fourth quarter for costs to clean up the spill of 11 million gallons of oil that spilled from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez and fouled the shoreline of pristine Prince William Sound last March .
The charges reduced Exxon 's 1989 net income to $ 3.8 billion , compared to $ 5.26 billion in 1988 .
Revenue totaled $ 96.1 billion in 1989 , compared to $ 88.6 billion the year before .
