SUMMARY A lengthy statement attributed to the imprisoned Shining Path leadership , published recently in a leading opposition newspaper , provides what appears to be a strategic rationale for the peace proposal made by the insurgents last fall .
While the newspaper has accepted the document as an authentic call for peace by the Shining Path , the paper has also stressed that the peace called for in the statement is nothing more than a temporary tactical retreat by the Shining Path leaders and is not , as President Alberto Fujimori has contended , an implicit admission of defeat .
END SUMMARY Although La Republica , a prominent anti-Fujimori daily , provided little information on the origins of the `` important and unusual '' document that it published in a special 25 January supplement , it assured its readers that the lengthy ideological tract explaining the Shining Path 's `` struggle for a peace agreement '' was a genuine Shining Path statement .
The paper claimed that the `` anonymous sources '' who supplied the `` secret '' document provided `` full authentication '' and that `` experts '' consulted by the paper also `` agreed '' that the document was the handiwork of imprisoned Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman -LRB- La Republica , 26 January -RRB- .
