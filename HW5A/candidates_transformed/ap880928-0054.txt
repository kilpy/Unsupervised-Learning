Ben Johnson spent his homecoming in seclusion , without the Olympic gold medal and the hero 's welcome , as Canadians bemoaned the fate of the sprinter who failed the drug test .
Returning to Canada on Tuesday , Johnson , 26 , dodged reporters and the public , refusing to talk about the muscle-building and illegal steroid Stanzolol found in his system after he won the 100-meter dash as the world 's fastest human .
But on the flight from South Korea , he denied using the drugs even though Olympic officials said the results were indisputable .
`` I got nothing to hide , '' Johnson told The Boston Globe during the flight to New York , where he then boarded another plane for Canada .
