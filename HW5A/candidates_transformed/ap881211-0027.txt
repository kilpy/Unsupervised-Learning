The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee says hearings are planned next year into how the U.S. Forest Service handled last summer 's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West , including one-third of Yellowstone National Park .
`` The major problem is that in speaking to people from the area , you speak to two and you get three opinions , '' says Rep. Kika de la Garza , a Texas Democrat .
`` The best thing to do is to sit down and have them all put it on the record and then sift through what happened and see if anything needs to be done . ''
De la Garza said the hearings would focus on forest fire practices , and `` can a catastrophe of that nature be avoided or was it a catastrophe ? ''
