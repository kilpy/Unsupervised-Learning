Turbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia , De Beers ' newest diamond mine , 30km from South Africa 's borders with Botswana and Zimbabwe .
Only weeks before the mine came into production in July 1992 at a cost of USDollars 400m , De Beers ' Central Selling Organisation , which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough -LRB- uncut -RRB- diamonds , imposed quotas on its producer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from Angola .
For a time Venetia , the first mine of any sort in South Africa to gain permission for seven-day working , moved to a five-day week .
This year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so that the CSO is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to take from producers .
