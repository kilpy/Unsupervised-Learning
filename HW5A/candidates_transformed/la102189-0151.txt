The director of the county Social Services Agency wants all Orange County residents , including illegal aliens , to be counted in the 1990 Census , and he will ask the Board of Supervisors to support his position .
A resolution doing just that will be introduced at the supervisors ' meeting Tuesday .
Agency officials said that if illegal aliens were to be excluded from the count , it would mean that , on paper , the county had 200,000 fewer residents than the county 's actual population .
That lower figure would result in the loss of an estimated $ 56 million a year in federal revenue , they said .
