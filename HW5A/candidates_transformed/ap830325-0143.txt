Millions of gallons of crude oil that spilled when a tanker ran aground spread across a wildlife-rich stretch of ocean Saturday , and Alaska 's chief environmental officer criticized cleanup efforts as too slow .
The biggest oil spill in U.S. history created a slick about seven miles long and seven miles wide in Prince William Sound .
The Coast Guard said only Reef Island and the western edge of Bligh Island had been touched by the slick .
`` This situation , I think , was everyone 's secret nightmare about what could happen with oil traffic in the sound , '' said Dennis Kelso , commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation .
