Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis than whites do , and one important reason appears to be a genetic susceptibility to the disease , according to a study today .
The research found that when living conditions are identical , black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the TB bacteria .
The relatively high rate of TB among blacks has traditionally been blamed on crowded housing and other conditions of poverty .
While social factors undoubtedly play a central role , the study suggests that innate susceptibility also contributes .
