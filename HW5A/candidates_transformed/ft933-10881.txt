IN California , labour leaders , environmentalists and the ` Perotistas ' supporting Mr Ross Perot have signed a Declaration of War against the North American Free Trade Agreement .
The site of the signing ceremony in Sacramento sent a warning to the city 's congressman , Mr Bob Matsui , one of the leading proponents of Nafta in the US House of Representatives .
In Washington state , Nafta opponents wrote alternative menus for a dinner given for Mr Rufus Yerxa , the Deputy US Trade Representative .
These featured the potential chemical content of the dishes if the free trade pact becomes a reality and allegedly toxic-laden Mexican produce floods into the US .
