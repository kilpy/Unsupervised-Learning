A French DC-10 jetliner with 171 people aboard experienced a powerful high-altitude explosion , possibly from a terrorist bomb , before crashing in a remote desert region of Niger in northern Africa , officials in France said Wednesday .
In Washington , intelligence specialists said they believe that the jetliner may have been bombed by people seeking to retaliate against France for its recent actions in Lebanon .
For several months , France has played an active part in the Lebanon crisis , attempting to broker a settlement between Christian and pro-Syrian forces .
Late last month , the French government sent a naval task force of five warships into Lebanese waters as part of what President Francois Mitterrand called a `` rescue mission '' for several thousand French nationals living in the war-torn country .
