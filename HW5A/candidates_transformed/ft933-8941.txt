INVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River Limpopo in Zimbabwe , which De Beers , the South African group that dominates the diamond business , discovered but then let get away .
The mine is River Ranch , 12km upstream from Beitbridge on the southern border of Zimbabwe .
De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to concentrate instead on another site 60km away and , importantly , given the heat generated by the politics of the region , across the border in South Africa .
After an investment of Dollars 500m that site went into production as Venetia , one of the world 's biggest diamond mines .
