SLOVENIA 'S economic prospects would improve significantly if it could settle its relations with the former National Bank of Yugoslavia -LRB- NBY -RRB- , or central bank , establish new relations with foreign creditors as rapidly as possible , and join the International Monetary Fund and World Bank .
Relations with the NBY are complicated .
Before Slovenia declared independence , any foreign exchange deposits which Slovene citizens deposited in banks in Slovenia were transferred to the NBY .
These deposits amount to Dollars 1.2 bn .
