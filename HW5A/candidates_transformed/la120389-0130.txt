The names will be different , but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of Hugo and Gilbert may be prowling the Atlantic , Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the future .
`` The probability of more intense hurricanes in the Atlantic region is greater in the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and '80s , '' says meteorologist William M. Gray of Colorado State University , who analyzes hurricane patterns .
Gray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the '50s and '60s , because of an apparent break in the periodic West African drought .
Rainfall in the Sahel , typically associated with more intense hurricane activity , was above average in 1988 for the first time since 1969 , he says .
