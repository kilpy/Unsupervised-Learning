There are two solid reasons for congressional term limitation that economists , at least those of the public-choice persuasion , should fully appreciate .
First , the less time that a politician spends inside the Beltway the less his or her common sense will be corrupted by the `` culture of ruling '' that exists there .
To have microphones pushed in your face every day and to be asked your opinion on everything under the sun is a corrupting influence .
Soon you start thinking your opinion is more important than it really is and , worse , that perhaps you should codify your opinion on everything under the sun .
