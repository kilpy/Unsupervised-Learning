But Sen. Howard Metzenbaum , D-Ohio , said the Senate Judiciary Committee , in confirming four justices without learning how they felt about abortion , has `` given them a free ride '' and should be tougher in ferreting out Thomas ' views.
; `` The failure to give an answer may cause me and others to be unwilling to vote for his confirmation , '' Metzenbaum said on `` CBS This Morning . ''
; Sen. Arlen Specter , R-Pa. , noted that Metzenbaum did not press Justice David Souter during confirmation hearings about his position on abortion .
`` I do not think it is appropriate to ask a nominee the ultimate question as to how he is going to decide a specific case , '' Specter said.
