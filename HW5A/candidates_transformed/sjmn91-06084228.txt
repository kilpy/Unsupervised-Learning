St. Martin 's , 306 pp.
, $ 18.95 ; CHARLIE Francis , testifying in 1988 in Toronto at a federal inquiry about the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports , seemed a mad scientist , something on the order of Dr. Frankenstein .
Francis , the Canadian national sprint coach , knew the polysyllabic names and complex characteristics of steroids -- furazabol , stanozolol , Dianabol -- as if they were members of his family .
And although he spoke of his athletes as if they were family members , too , he made it plain , under oath , that he had given them every steroid combination imaginable , his experiments all carefully calibrated , charted and analyzed.
