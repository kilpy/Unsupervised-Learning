Solar telescopes yielded views of flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible across western North America .
`` There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature , '' said Ed Krupp , director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles , where 600 children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37 percent of the sun 's surface at 10:50 a.m. PST .
`` It was certainly a lively crowd , '' he said .
`` There was a festival atmosphere . ''
