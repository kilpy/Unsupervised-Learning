Now , in the wake of that firestorm , local firefighters are looking up at the hills that surround this area and wondering not whether , but only when and where.
; `` I know it 's there , '' said Saratoga Fire Chief Ernest Kraule .
`` Every fire chief -- there 's 12 of us in this county -- knows it 's there . ''
; The danger is in the Saratoga foothills , where Kraule 's department has battled nine deliberately set fires since June -- most recently Oct. 19 , the same day Oakland firefighters thought they had contained a brush fire that a day later blossomed into the deadly firestorm.
