MR HARRY Oppenheimer , whose family effectively controls the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and De Beers , is to visit Russia next week at a time when the republic is considering a big shake-up in its diamond industry .
His visit also comes at a time when the beleaguered diamond industry is rife with rumours about unofficial exports from Russia contributing to the present market turmoil which might force De Beers to cut its dividend payment this year .
Some industry observers suggest that the presence in Russia of Mr Oppenheimer , who will be 84 in October , will be timely .
` It appears to be another sign that the former De Beers ' chairman is taking a more active role in guiding the company through its current difficulties , ' says the Diamantaire newsletter today .
