Two propositions on California 's Nov. 6 ballot would , among other things , limit the terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators .
Proposition 131 would limit statewide elected officials to two consecutive four-year terms , state legislators to 12 consecutive years in office ; Proposition 140 would hold Assembly members to six years in office , state senators and statewide elected officials to eight .
If either passes , or both do , what would state government be like by 1996 and thereafter ?
Would passage of such measures be likely to spur similar legislation in other states , or at the federal level ?
