The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or ` mad cow ' disease - which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the UK - is causing a new wave of public concern .
New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease , a brain disorder similar to BSE .
Richard Lacey , a microbiology professor at Leeds University and the leading critic of government policy on BSE , said the deaths this year of two farmers whose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to chance .
He believes that BSE can trigger human brain disease .
