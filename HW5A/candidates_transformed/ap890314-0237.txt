Inside a small motor home , Joanne Pierluissi raised her sleeve as nurse Mary Perez inserted a needle into the vein above her forearm , drawing blood into a tube for a diabetes test .
As her daughters watched , Pierluissi , 24 , said it was for them , as much as for herself , that she agreed to be tested for the deadly killer of Hispanics .

Hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes as the general population , and 40 percent of the 700,000 victims in Texas are Mexican-American .
