Dealing with his first major hurricane as director of the National Hurricane Center , Bob Sheets was n't skipping a beat Tuesday as a multitude of reporters fired questions at him .
Sheets , who was acting director during the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season and was named director in March , spent most of the morning on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large monitor showing the destructive Hurricane Gilbert sprawled across much of the western Caribbean .
His schedule of interviews was timed to the minute .
But Sheets , rosy-cheeked and good-natured , did n't so much as flinch in his seat .
