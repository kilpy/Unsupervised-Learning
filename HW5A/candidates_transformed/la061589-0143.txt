Ben Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100-meter dash and it should be awarded to Carl Lewis , many U.S. track and field officials and athletes said Wednesday in the aftermath of Johnson admitting to his steroid use .
Johnson testified this week at a Canadian inquiry that his seven-year involvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs included injections before the 1987 World Championships in Rome , where he set the existing world record of 9.83 seconds .
`` I would have to see the evidence , but if he was on drugs at the time of the World Championships , my thought would be to remove his record , '' said Ollan Cassell , executive director of The Athletics Congress , the national governing board for the sport .
Cassell is also a vice president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation , the world governing organization .
