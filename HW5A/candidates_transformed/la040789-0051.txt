Backed by public antipathy toward the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster , Gov.
Steve Cowper on Thursday threatened to close down the trans-Alaska oil pipeline unless its owners meet his terms for improved safety and cleanup measures .
At the same time , it was disclosed that federal officials are probing the possibility that Exxon 's 987-foot oil tanker was on autopilot shortly before it ran aground and that the electronic navigation aid confused the crew and contributed to the accident .
After meeting personally with top executives from three of the seven oil companies that own the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. earlier in the week , Cowper asked them to respond by noon Thursday to his six-point safety plan .
