The root of the problems with Congress is that , barring major scandal , it is almost impossible to defeat an incumbent .
In the past three elections , 96 % or more of House incumbents who ran won .
This lack of turnover has resulted in legislative arrogance , a dearth of new ideas and unaccountability .
Congress just violated its legal budget deadline ; where are the special prosecutors ?
