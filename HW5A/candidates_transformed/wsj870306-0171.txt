Confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s , De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. , the South African concern that controls 80 % of the world 's uncut-diamond market , is thriving .
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is floundering , and the international tin cartel has collapsed .
But De Beers not only halted a fall in rough-diamond prices , it raised them an average 14.5 % last year .
Sales still soared 40 % to a near-record $ 2.56 billion , double the $ 1.26 billion posted in the 1982 doldrums .
