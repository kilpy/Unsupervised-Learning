The government of the northern republic of Slovenia said Friday that Serbia , in the south and east , is attempting to `` oust us from Yugoslavia . ''
The statement from the Slovenian presidency followed Serbia 's decision Tuesday to ban all political and economic contacts with Slovenia .
Liberal , prosperous Slovenia and the hard-line communist leadership of Serbia have been feuding for years .
But the Serbian action Tuesday was the gravest threat to the unity of the Yugoslav federation since the death of the nation 's post-World War II leader Josip Broz Tito in 1980 .
