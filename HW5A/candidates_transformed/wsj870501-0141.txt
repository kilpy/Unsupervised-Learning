In the late 1970s , poor farmers living in communities surrounding this small town began replacing their fields of cacao and coffee with coca to meet the growing U.S. demand for cocaine .
Like thousands of other farmers in Peru 's Upper Huallaga Valley , they discovered that while cacao and coffee could give their families enough to eat , coca could make them rich .
Lately , someone else has been attracted by its big profits : the country 's murderous guerrillas , the Shining Path .
Development workers , farmers and priests in the area say that the rebels have steadily streamed into the Upper Huallaga , a vast stretch of jungle northeast of Lima , and the biggest coca-growing zone in the world .
