This week 's flare-up of Western wildfires ca n't hold a candle to the damage wrought by last year 's record-breaking fire season , but officials say a dry August could change everything .
Fire has charred more than 1.3 million acres of forest and range land since January in the contiguous United States , compared to 2.1 million acres by this time last year , fire officials said Monday .
`` Right now , the fire season is just starting to gear up , '' said Sandi Sacher , spokeswoman at the federal government 's wildfire command post in Boise , Idaho .
Nearly 10,000 firefighters in five Western states are battling hundreds of blazes , most of them sparked last week by lightning .
