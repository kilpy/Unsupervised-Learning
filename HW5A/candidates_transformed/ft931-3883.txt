GOVERNMENT veterinary and health experts were yesterday putting out reassuring messages about bovine spongiform encephalopathy -LRB- BSE -RRB- , or ` mad cow ' disease , in the face of growing public anxiety .
Dr Kenneth Calman , the government 's chief medical officer , yesterday repeated the official advice that beef can be eaten safely : ` There is no scientific evidence of a causal link between BSE in cattle and CJD in humans . '
One cause of concern is that the number of cases is continuing to rise , in spite of forecasts from the Ministry of Agriculture that the incidence of cases would peak last year and then decline rapidly .
Farmers reported 8,581 animals with BSE during the first nine weeks of this year compared with 8,099 in the same period last year .
