A crippled United Airlines DC-10 crashed a half-mile short of a runway while trying to make an emergency landing Wednesday afternoon , bursting into a cartwheeling fireball that broke into what one eyewitness described as `` 15,000 pieces '' and killing at least 123 of the 293 passengers and crew members on board .
Remarkably , as many as 166 persons survived the violent crash , according to Richard Vohs , a spokesman for Iowa Gov.
Terry E. Branstad .
The fate of four others was not immediately known .
