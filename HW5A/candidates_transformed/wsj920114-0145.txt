Mr. Goldwin 's mistake stems from his having confused a necessary with a sufficient condition .
The Second Amendment , in its language and its history , makes plain that the need for a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition for the right to keep and bear arms .
Yet Mr. Goldwin treats it as a necessary condition , which enables him to conclude that Congress could deny an individual the right to own a gun if he did not join the National Guard .
Mr. Goldwin makes this mistake , in turn , because he has misread Madison 's original version of the Second Amendment , which exempted conscientious objectors from military service .
