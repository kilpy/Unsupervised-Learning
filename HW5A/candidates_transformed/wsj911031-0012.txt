State statutes that bar first-time candidates from running for Congress have been held to add to the qualifications set forth in the Constitution and have been invalidated .
For example , the 1972 decision in Dillon v. Fiorina struck down a New Mexico law requiring candidates entering a congressional primary to have belonged to their party for a year and to pay a registration fee .
But state statutes that simply limit the tenure of existing congressional officeholders have not yet been tested in court .
The constitutionality of such state term limits may , however , be tested next month .
