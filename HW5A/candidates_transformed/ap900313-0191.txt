From a helicopter , the wave-washed beach looks as if the worst oil spill in U.S. history had never touched it .
Silvery sticks of driftwood poke through a deep blanket of snow , and smooth gray pebbles roll in the surf under the gaze of a bald eagle perched in a shoreside spruce .
But the view does n't impress Joe Bridgman of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation .
Dashing out as the chopper lands , he digs into the cobble beach and quickly finds what he knew he would .
