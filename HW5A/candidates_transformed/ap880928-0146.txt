The stripping of Ben Johnson 's Olympic gold medal in a drug scandal has wounded Canadian pride and shamed a nation hungry for a hero to replace hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky .
`` It 's like Wayne Gretzky getting run over by a car , '' said Pat Reid , the Canadian high-jump coach .
The spirit of a nation raced with Johnson when he won the gold medal in the 100 meters on Saturday with a world record time of 9.79 seconds .
The euphoria was dashed when Johnson tested positive for stanzolol , a muscle-building steroid outlawed by Olympic officials .
