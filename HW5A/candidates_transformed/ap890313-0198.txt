Inside a small motor home , Joanne Pierluissi raised her sleeve as nurse Mary Perez inserted a needle into the vein above her forearm , drawing blood into a tube for a diabetes test .
As her daughters watched , Pierluissi , 24 , said it was for them , as much as for herself , that she agreed to be tested for the deadly killer of Hispanics .
`` I was concerned because they said an aunt of mine had it and I just wanted to come for the checkup .
All of our family is going to go through the program to make sure that if we have it that we 'll do something about it . ''
