THE US administration has given the go-ahead for pilot plans to reform welfare benefits in Wisconsin and Georgia that could serve as experiments for the broader overhaul of the welfare system promised by President Bill Clinton .
The Wisconsin plan would cut off cash payments under the principal welfare programme , known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children , after two years , although it would continue to provide food stamps and health coverage .
The pilot scheme will be started in two counties in 1995 .
Republican Governor Tommy Thompson has made Wisconsin a pioneer in welfare reform , with experiments such as Schoolfare , which cuts welfare payments to teenage mothers who do not go to school .
