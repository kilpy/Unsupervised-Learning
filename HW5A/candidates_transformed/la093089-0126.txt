In a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations , the Senate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in the 1990 population count .
`` I 'm stunned , '' said Santa Ana City Council member Miguel A. Pulido .
Pulido and other Santa Ana council members say that the 1980 census substantially under-counted its population at 215,000 .
The city has been lobbying hard to have its illegal alien population -- estimated at 50,000 -- included in the 1990 count .
