Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics today `` in a complete state of shock , '' accused of cheating with drugs in the world 's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his gold medal .
The prize went to American Carl Lewis .
Many athletes accepted the accusation that Johnson used a muscle-building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been going on in track and field .
`` Everybody uses drugs , '' said sprinter Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone .
