Sir , Mr James Skinner -LRB- Letters , April 11 -RRB- charges me with misuse of statistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries .
He cites Africa to support his contention .
The statistics I used refer to Latin America , the principal thrust of the argument of the Bishop of Oxford , which focused largely on Brazil .
The bulk of African debt is owed to official lenders under various aid agreements .
