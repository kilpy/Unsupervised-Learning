Workmen tunneling under the English Channel have created the first land link between Britain and the Continent , connecting 31 miles of tunnel in a prodigious feat of engineering and finance .
TransManche Link , the construction consortium building the `` Chunnel '' said the historic linkup occurred at 8:25 p.m. Tuesday when British workers sent a probe 2 inches in diameter through to their French colleagues .
Linking England and France , the tunnel symbolizes the growing unification of Europe .
It also fulfills a dream of Napoleon , who wanted to send his armies through the tunnel to conquer Britain .
