Public officials throughout California have condemned a U.S. Senate vote Thursday to exclude illegal aliens from the 1990 census , saying the action will shortchange California in Congress and possibly deprive the state of millions of dollars of federal aid for medical emergency services and other programs for poor people .
`` I think it 's an outrageous piece of legislation and probably unconstitutional , '' Assemblyman Peter Chacon said Friday .
Chacon , a San Diego Democrat , is the chairman of the Assembly 's Elections , Reapportionment and Constitutional Amendments Committee .
At the same time , the Senate 's action has created great confusion and stirred hopes , especially among urban Democrats , that it will be overturned by the House of Representatives .
