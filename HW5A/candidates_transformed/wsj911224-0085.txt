Another argument is that a citizen Congress with its continuing flow of fresh faces into Washington would result in better government than that provided by representatives with lengthy tenure .
The counter-argument is that experience is an important characteristic for legislators .
Each viewpoint has some validity .
Presumably the best solution is to let the market decide , that is , to allow the electorate to determine the proper balance between freshness and experience .
