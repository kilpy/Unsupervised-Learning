Hurricane Joan 's 80 mph winds churned across the open Caribbean today on an unusual southern path that has forecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possible landfall .
There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead or missing in a town in Colombia the day before .
`` Joan is one of a kind , '' said Jim Gross , a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center .
`` You just do n't see many hurricanes that take this course and hug the coast . ''
