A 1987 state constitutional amendment broadening the right to bear arms means that even convicted felons may own guns , a judge ruled .
Cumberland County Superior Court Justice Stephen L. Perkins on Friday dismissed a charge of possession of a firearm by a felon against Edward Brown of Cumberland .
Prosecutors had argued that the amendment 's backers did not intend to allow felons to own guns , but the judge said nothing in the amendment indicated such an intent .
`` If Maine legislators and citizens wanted to restrict or qualify the right to keep and bear arms , they could have enacted a constitutional provision that contained the desired restrictions , '' Perkins wrote .
