Mother Nature conspired against this struggling marathon Sunday , serving up balmy , windy weather and wilting both the men 's and women 's fields .
Temperatures during the Old Style/Chicago marathon hovered in the mid-60s , with 53 % humidity .
The heat sapped the strength of most runners , giving the patient and steady runners a distinct advantage .
Among the men , Paul Davies-Hale of England proved the most patient , winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 minutes 25 seconds , in his first marathon ever .
