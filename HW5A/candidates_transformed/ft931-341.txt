SLOVENES always had at least as much in common with their Alpine neighbours as with their Balkan partners in the former Yugoslavia .
Since Slovenia 's declaration of independence in June 1991 , the gap between the peaceful , ethnically homogeneous new republic of 2m people and the war-impoverished rest of former Yugoslavia has widened inexorably .
` We have been very lucky , ' says President Milan Kucan , the wily former communist who led Slovenia 's drive for independence from the Serb - dominated federation .
But he , like Mr Janez Drnovsek , the prime minister of Slovenia 's three-pronged coalition government , makes clear that Slovenia suffers economically from the disintegration of Yugoslavia and would be one of the principal gainers from a resolution of the bloody Balkan imbroglio .
