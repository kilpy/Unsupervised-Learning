A source speaking on the condition of anonymity said the panel report did not focus on Gates -- who said he would resign if the commission agreed with his critics that he created a climate within the department that condoned racism and brutality.
; The report `` deals with management issues , not directly with the chief of police , '' the source said.
; Commission members and others who had seen the report declined comment Monday .
Gates also would n't comment.
