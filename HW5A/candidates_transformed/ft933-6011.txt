President Bill Clinton 's pledge to ` end welfare as we know it ' was one of the most popular lines in last year 's election campaign .
His idea of a strict two-year time limit on welfare cheques appealed to voters -LRB- especially ` Reagan democrats ' -RRB- not just as a way of cutting government spending and thus reducing taxes , but as a solution to the nation 's most pressing social problems .
In the American mind , welfare has become synonymous with such evils as urban decay , fatherless children , drug abuse and violent crime .
By promising radical welfare reform , Mr Clinton was sending a powerful subliminal message : he would wage war on all the diseases that are ravaging urban society .
