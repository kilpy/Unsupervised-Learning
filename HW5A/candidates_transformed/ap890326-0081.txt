The tanker that caused the nation 's biggest oil spill was being illegally piloted by its third mate when the vessel ran aground on a reef , Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday .
Alaska 's governor , meanwhile , declared once-pristine Prince William Sound a disaster area as the toll on the waterway 's abundant wildlife began to mount .
The Coast Guard said the slick and patches of oil separated from it were spread over an area of about 100 square miles .
Exxon Shipping spokesman Brian Dunphy told The Associated Press that the captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez , Joseph Hazelwood , was not on the bridge at the time of the accident and that third mate Gregory Cousins was in command .
