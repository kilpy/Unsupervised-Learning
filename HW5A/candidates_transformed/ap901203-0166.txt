At least four moderate earthquakes rattled parts of the world , but there was nary a tremor Monday along the New Madrid Fault , where a scientist said a earthquake was likely to occur .
`` This is just a normal day , '' said Waverly Person , chief of the U.S. Geological Survey 's National Earthquake Information Center .
`` We 're not backing the prediction at all . ''
Along the New Madrid Fault , some schools were canceled and residents purchased earthquake emergency kits and others left town , just in case climatologist Iben Browning was right .
