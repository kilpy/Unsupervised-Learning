A colossal tunneling machine is boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of Dover , pursuing a dream born in Napoleon 's time that is coming true at last .
Another is digging from the French coast in what the tunnel builders call the largest civil engineering project now under way in the world .
The 31-mile tunnel , 24 miles of it underwater , will cut the London-Paris journey from six hours to three , as fast as a scheduled airline .
It will enable freight to travel on one train instead of being shifted to trucks for a cross-channel ferry trip subject to weather and shipping strikes .
