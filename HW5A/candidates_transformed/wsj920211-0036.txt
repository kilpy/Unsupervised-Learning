That same correspondent accused me of calling for `` removal of all guns from American citizens through the implementation of total regulations . ''
I said nothing like that .
I said that although the Second Amendment has nothing to do with private uses of arms , there is an unenumerated but undeniable right to own a gun .
We have many rights not enumerated in the Constitution , such as the right to marry , drive a car or own a dog .
