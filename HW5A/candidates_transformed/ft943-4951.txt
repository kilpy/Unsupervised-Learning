The Jwaneng mine , on the fringes of the Kalahari desert in Botswana , is known as ' a gem in the world of gems ' because it almost certainly is the richest diamond mine in the world - at least in terms of the value of the stones it yields .
Jwaneng 's position is being reinforced by a USDollars 160m expansion programme at present being completed three months ahead of schedule and under budget .
Meanwhile , 160km west of Kimberley in the northern Cape Province of South Africa , another diamond mine , the Finsch , where operations started in 1964 , has been given a new lease of life .
Having dug an open pit 423 metres deep , miners have now gone underground .
