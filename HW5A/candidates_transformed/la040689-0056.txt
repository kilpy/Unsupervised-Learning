Exxon salvage crews successfully refloated the stricken tanker Exxon Valdez on Wednesday as the former captain of the vessel surrendered to authorities in New York to face criminal charges in the massive oil spill .
Joseph Hazelwood , 42 , surrendered to police in a Long Island suburb of New York City and hours later Judge Kenneth Rohl set bail at $ 500,000 -- 10 times what Alaskan authorities had sought .
Hazelwood 's lawyer said he had not decided whether to waive extradition proceedings and return to Alaska to face the charges ; Hazelwood was not required to enter a plea Wednesday .
Fired by Exxon After the Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24 , Hazelwood was found to be legally drunk and was fired by Exxon .
