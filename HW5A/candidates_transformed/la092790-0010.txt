Proposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators are popular and getting more so , according to the pundits and the polls .
Students of government like me find it hard to understand why .
Contrary to most of the propaganda on the subject , these constitutional changes wo n't do what their proponents say they want to accomplish .
For example , term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money on elections .
