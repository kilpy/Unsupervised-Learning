MR Lewis Preston , World Bank president , yesterday promised to strengthen the bank 's efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries .
` Poverty reduction must be the benchmark against which our performance as a development institution is judged , ' he said .
However , he failed to respond to demands from the Clinton administration for the bank to set more precise targets for the proportion of lending that should have an explicit poverty focus .
In congressional testimony this week , Mr Lloyd Bentsen , US treasury secretary , said the US wanted to see more funding that ` will create social and economic safety nets ' for poor people most affected by war , civil strife and economic mismanagement .
