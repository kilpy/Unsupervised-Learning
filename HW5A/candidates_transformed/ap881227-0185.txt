Shining Path guerrillas , who started their bloody uprising in the mountains eight years ago , are moving into the shantytowns that encircle the capital like a noose .
Abimael Guzman , founder of the rebel movement , has said of the slums and their people : `` The immense masses of the shantytowns are like belts of steel that lock in the enemy and hold back his reactionary forces . ''
His Maoist rebels , once secretive fanatics , are becoming a political force that seeks public support in Huaycan and the other makeshift communities where two-thirds of Lima 's 7 million people scrape along .
About 10,000 people live in Huaycan .
