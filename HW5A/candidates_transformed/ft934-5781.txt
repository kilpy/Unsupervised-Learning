The smoke has cleared a little .
After seven long years , the US Congress this week passed its first significant gun control law since the assassinations of Mr Robert Kennedy and Rev Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 .
The legislation - known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady , the former White House press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on purchases of handguns .
It would give law enforcement authorities time to check the buyer 's background .
