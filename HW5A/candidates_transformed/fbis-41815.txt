The finding uncovers a threat to breeding other species in captivity unless it can be shown that they are not equally vulnerable .
The scientists say there is no evidence that similar transmission is occurring among cows .
The zoo 's small herd of kudu , spiral-horned antelopes closely related to cows , has been severely hit by a disease similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy -LRB- BSE -RRB- .
