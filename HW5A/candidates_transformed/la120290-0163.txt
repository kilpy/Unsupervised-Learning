Cheers erupted Saturday on both sides of the English Channel when British and French workers digging the Channel Tunnel finally met after knocking out a passage large enough to walk through and shake hands .
`` Today , for the first time , men can cross the channel underground , '' French President Francois Mitterrand said .
`` What a brilliant sign of the vitality of our two countries . ''
The breakthrough came in a 6-foot-tall service tunnel that will be used to maintain two rail tunnels still being bored .
