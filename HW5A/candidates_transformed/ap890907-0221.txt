The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who dominate Peru 's Upper Huallaga River Valley have brought their own law and order to a cocaine-corrupted , violence-ridden region .
With a system they call `` revolutionary justice , '' they have banned drug abuse , prostitution , homosexuality and thievery from the villages they control .
`` Two years ago you could not travel the roads without being held up , but the ` companeros ' put an end to that , '' said cab driver David Nicolas , referring to the guerrillas by the Spanish term for comrades .
`` They killed a few bandits and the rest got the message . ''
