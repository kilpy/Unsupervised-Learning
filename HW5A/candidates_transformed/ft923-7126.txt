IT IS ironic that there is an unprecedented , greedy rush for diamonds by miners in Angola and Canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the world 's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market .
In Canada 's Northwest Territories , the discovery of 81 small diamonds , some of gem quality , has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in the history of the North American industry .
Stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large and prospectors have claimed every piece of land within 300 km -LRB- 185 miles -RRB- of the discovery .
In spite of all this hectic activity , it is very unlikely that anyone will find enough big diamonds to make the development of Canada 's first diamond mine worthwhile .
