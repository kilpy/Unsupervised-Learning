The lawsuit , which has been pending for nine months , arose out of two articles published by the Enquirer in June 1990 reporting on Miss Taylor 's condition and activities at St. John 's Hospital , Santa Monica , Calif. , where she was treated last spring for pneumonia .
The Enquirer said that after gaining access to all of Miss Taylor 's medical records , it is satisfied that the articles reporting on the actress 's medical condition and the report that she was drinking were in error .
The paper said it published the articles in good faith reliance on information provided to it , but the information was inaccurate .
Iain Calder , Enquirer editor , said in a statement , `` we regret the inaccuracies in the articles but are pleased that this dispute has come to an amicable end . ''
