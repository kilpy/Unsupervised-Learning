Thus began another chapter in one of medicine 's most bizarre mysteries , a tale of sick sheep and mad cows , cannibals and Pennsylvanians , ancient life forms and a cat named Max .

It is infectious , invariably fatal and as insidious as termites , sometimes eating away brain cells for years without detection before a critical mass is spongified .
Then , over a few months , motor control buckles and cognition crumbles .
