In his State of the Union address last January , President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years .
He instructed his charges to draw up plans for `` immediate action '' that would enable poor families to achieve `` real and lasting emancipation '' from welfare dependency .
`` The success of welfare , '' he said , `` should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare . ''
The president 's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families .
